   _[_]_  SNO+_MON - monitoring software
    (")             for the SNO+ project
`--( : )--'
  (  :  )
""`-...-'"" 

To compile everything, just use 'make'.

SNO+_MON tries to connect to defined monitor points, and
then takes the data from them and does stuff with it.

Yeah, that's vague, but that's the spec I have, too.
